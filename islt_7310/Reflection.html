    <h2>Personal Reflection</h2>
    <p id="P1">I  have enjoyed the classes I have taken in the library science program at the University of Missouri-Columbia.  I have taken a real variety of classes from Youth Services to Copyright to Website Design.  I have learned a lot, as well from many of the specific assignments.  These assignments had us students tackling very practical skills or competencies that would be required for any librarian.   I have addressed several of these specific signature assignments on my projects page of this online portfolio.</p> 
    <p class="Prest">I think that I most enjoyed the assignments in the Reference Sources and Services class.  I enjoyed many of the more nerdy assignments of the Reference class, like making a LibGuide and editing Wikipedia pages.  Another favorite class was the Special Libraries class in which the class explored many different niche or specialty libraries.  Unfortunately, we did exploration virtually through library presenters.  We explored eight niche libraries through presentations by their and explored about 20 more through student presentations.  This class gave me an idea of the breadth of areas and jobs in which librarian skills and competencies can be put to good use.   I also enjoyed the opportunities to do research in the context of performing community analyses and writing advocacy papers and grant requests in other classes.</p>
    <h2>Career goals</h2>
    <p class="Prest">My classes and assignments have led me to believe that I would enjoy a job in the library science where I would continue to be able to do research and/or assist others in their research.  So particularly work in an academic or specialty library is appealing.  I like the idea of being able to use or create tools, databases or LibGuides or similar resources that help library users to locate the information that they are seeking.</p>
    <p class="Prest">Given that I do have a background in law, I am going to continue to explore the opportunities available to me in the specialty of area of law librarianship.  To that end, I am completing my practicum at the Law Library Association of St. Louis.  During this practicum, I have been able to do several projects where I have created or updated resources that assist patrons in their search for legal research resources.Given that I do have a background in law, I am going to continue to explore the opportunities available to me in the specialty of area of law librarianship.
