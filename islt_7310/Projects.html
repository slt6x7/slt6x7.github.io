            <p>This was one of my favorite assignments.  In ISLT 7314 Reference Sources and Services we learned about finding aids and pathfinders.  Librarians can create these useful tools to assist their users in finding appropriate resources.  LibGuides are great online pathfinders.  I created a LibGuide on the topic of terrorism.  This exercise gave me the opportunity to use and gain command of many references resources.  Additionally, I thought it was a useful and challenging exercise as it made me really focus on the user and how to organize and present the of resources in a helpful way for that user. </p>

        <div> <h3>Advocacy Paper</h3>
            <p>I wrote an advocacy paper for ISLT 9433 Youth Services in Libraries.  In the assignment, I am the Youth Services manager whose library is facing budget cuts.  The essay is written to a library board advocating for continued funding of the Young Adult Services. I learned to use both evaluative and analysis skills in the context of advocating for a community of library users.</p><p> Advocacy is an important part of managing libraries.  Librarians need to be able to effetively advocate for funds to meet the needs of their users.  Librarians must able to communicate the community's needs and how the library can meet those needs get the support and resources from funders, community partners and stakeholders.</p>
