        <div><h3>Special Libraries Presentation</h3>
        <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRPCSKf_MIMQUEIXJwBM6ZjG_OHllV7t8FpI0qZ3CuiVPb6zLDM0ZLP01Q1X_IlI5eUcIlUtC2IwdyS/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000">

        <p>I took ISLT9445 Special Libraries and Information Center during Summer 2020.  This class explores all aspects of librarianship in the context of specialty of niche libraries.  The class has speakers from specialty librarians.  Speakers included a wine librarian, the corporate librarian for Rolls Royce, a cheese librarian and the head of Missouri’s Department of Correction librarian.  We also got to explore a lot of other niche libraries through student presentations.  Some examples of student presentations were LucasFilm Research library, the Missouri Botanical Garden library, Jannes Library in the Kansas City Art Institute, as well as other zoo and botanical garden libraries, law libraries, and historical libraries. This class really impressed upon me the wide variety of environments that can benefit from the skills, abilities and competencies of a well-trained librarian. </p>
        <p>For my student presentation, I reported on the Law Library Association of St. Louis.  I was able to visit the library in person, as well, as interview the librarian by phone.  My slideshow played in conjunction with an oral presentation to my fellow students.

        <div><h3>LibGuide Creation</h3>
            <p><a href="https://lis-missouri.libguides.com/c.php?g=979236&p=7081035">
                <img src="Images/TerrorismLibGuide.png" alt="Lib Guide Homepage"></a></p>
            <p>This was one of my favorite assignments.  In ISLT 7314 Reference Sources and Services we learned about finding aids and pathfinders.  Librarians can create these useful tools to assist their users in finding appropriate resource materials.  LibGuides are great online pathfinders. Many academic libraries use LibGuides on their library websites to assist students in their research.</p> <p>I created a LibGuide on the topic of terrorism.  This exercise gave me the opportunity to use and gain command of many references resources.  Additionally, I thought it was a useful and challenging exercise as it made me really focus on the user and how to organize and present the of resources in a helpful way for that user. </p>

        <div><h3>Grant Narrative</h3>
            <p>I wrote a grant narrative for ISLT 7315 Management of Information Agencies.  This was a signature assignment for the course.  I think this assignment was beneficial because it required me to research an area of need within a real-life library’s community of users.  And then attempt to communicate that need to a grant review board.  The assignment also required the creation of a budget and evaluation procedures.  The exercise was set to replicate a real-life grant application where accuracy to the specific guidelines of the grant were required.  I think this assignment was important because it also emphasized a librarian’s need to be able to communicate well and advocate for the library’s community of users.</p>

        <div> <h3>Advocacy Paper</h3>
            <p>I wrote an advocacy paper for ISLT 9433 Youth Services in Libraries.  In the assignment, I am the Youth Services manager whose library is facing budget cuts.  The essay is written to a library board advocating for continued funding of the Young Adult Services. I learned to use both evaluative and analysis skills in the context of advocating for a community of library users.</p><p> Advocacy is an important part of managing libraries.  Librarians need to be able to effetively advocate for funds to meet the needs of their users.  Librarians must able to communicate the community's needs and how the library can meet those needs get the support and resources from funders, community partners and stakeholders.</p>
