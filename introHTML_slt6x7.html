<title>Welcome to Sherry Taylor's website</title>

My name is Sherry Taylor.  I am almost done with the library science program at University of Missouri-Columbia.  I have only two courses and my practicum left.  My practicum is at the Law Library Association of St. Louis this summer.  I have no website application or development experience.  I am taking this class because I think a good website is important for libraries.  Libraries communicate with their users through their websites.  And libraries deliver resources to their users through their websites.  Through this class, I hope to learn how to design, create and edit a useful website.  For fun, I play tennis and I fiddle around with arts and crafts projects.
